        In the 70’s I ask my father to see if he could locate an original Bealby
        plough. He contacted a gentleman called Charlie Sheldon (I believe
        Jane’s husband was related?).
      </p>
      <p>
        Charlie Shelton had two and sold one to my Dad for £30. I have two sons,
        so a year later I asked Dad to see if he could buy the other. Charlie
        Sheldon agreed and also to the “same price as last time”. I sent him a
        cheque, which was duly returned as he wanted cash not a cheque!! My
        father told me that when he was with Charlie Sheldon fixing the “deal”,
        he phoned his son to say what he had done. I believe his son was most
        unhappy with what had been done, but Charlie apparently said that the
        deal had been done and that was that.
      </p>
      <p>
        My father told me that his father had a number of “Match Ploughs” which
        were used in competitions. I believe that when the brothers came home
        during WW2 on leave, they burnt the ploughs on the fire due to wood
        shortages.
